# KiTTY (PuTTY 0.84 port)

**KiTTY** is a feature-rich fork of [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/),
the free Windows SSH/Telnet client. This branch is a **forward-port of the entire KiTTY feature
set onto current PuTTY 0.84** — so you get KiTTY's extras on top of a modern, security-patched
PuTTY core (≈1,200 upstream commits newer than KiTTY's original 0.76b base).

> ⚠️ **Beta release** (`0.84.1.41-beta`). The full KiTTY feature set on a modern, security-patched PuTTY 0.84 core — including a post-quantum key-exchange warning and a console CLI key generator (`kittygen-cli.exe`). Please still read the known issues below.

## ⬇️ Download

Grab the latest build from the **[Releases page →](https://github.com/hknet/KiTTY/releases/latest)**.

Current release — **[KiTTY 0.84.1.41-beta](https://github.com/hknet/KiTTY/releases/tag/kitty-0.84.1.41-beta)**:

| Download | Use it when |
|---|---|
| **[Installer — per-user (no admin)](https://github.com/hknet/KiTTY/releases/download/kitty-0.84.1.41-beta/KiTTY-0.84.1.41-beta-x64-peruser.msi)** | **Recommended.** Installs for your user only, **no UAC prompt** (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\KiTTY`). |
| **[Installer — system-wide](https://github.com/hknet/KiTTY/releases/download/kitty-0.84.1.41-beta/KiTTY-0.84.1.41-beta-x64-system.msi)** | All users, into `Program Files` (requires admin). |
| **[Portable ZIP](https://github.com/hknet/KiTTY/releases/download/kitty-0.84.1.41-beta/kitty-0.84.1.41-beta.zip)** | No install — run from a folder or USB stick. Includes `kitty_portable.exe` and all command-line tools. |

Both installers add Start-Menu + Desktop shortcuts and an Add/Remove-Programs entry, and uninstall
cleanly. If your antivirus flags `kitty.exe` (UPX-compression heuristics), use the `kitty_nocompress.exe`
included in the ZIP — it's identical, just unpacked. Every download is checksummed (`SHA256SUMS` in the ZIP).

## What's included (KiTTY features on PuTTY 0.84)

~43 KiTTY features are ported and verified, including:

- **Window:** transparency, maximize / fullscreen / saved position on start, always-on-top, roll-up,
  send-to-tray (auto + on-minimize), per-session icons, background image.
- **Hyperlinks:** clickable URLs in the terminal (Ctrl+click configurable) with **underlining**.
- **Sessions & automation:** auto-command after login, auto-password, anti-idle keepalive,
  port-knocking, duplicate-session, immediate-quit, session export, scripting (rutty).
- **Transfers / backends:** ZModem send/receive, WinSCP & pscp integration, **adb** (Android) backend.
- **Terminal:** font resize, protect, print, negative/B&W colours, clear/restart log, far2l extensions.
- **Storage:** registry **or** portable file/dir storage (`kitty_portable.exe`), `kitty.ini` configuration.
- Plus the standard PuTTY tools, renamed KiTTY-style: `klink`, `kscp`, `ksftp`, `kageant`, `kittygen`.
- `kittygen-cli.exe` — a console-mode CLI key generator (generate, convert, fingerprint) for use in scripts and pipelines. Run `kittygen-cli --help` for options.

Most KiTTY extras read from a `kitty.ini` (`[KiTTY]` section). The release includes an inert `kitty.ini.example` with commented options; copy/rename it to `kitty.ini` only when you want an active config file. For example, URL hyperlinks are enabled with:

```ini
[KiTTY]
hyperlink=yes
```

See **[`FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md)** for the full feature reference, including how to enable each one, and **[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)** for what changed in each release.

## Known issues

This is a **beta**: most KiTTY features are restored and verified, but a few have limitations
or still want real-world testing. The full, per-release list is in
**[`KNOWN-ISSUES.md`](KNOWN-ISSUES.md)** — current highlights:

- **Antivirus / SmartScreen & UPX** — `kitty.exe` and `kitty_portable.exe` are UPX-compressed
  and can trip heuristic AV. If flagged, use the identical, unpacked `*_nocompress.exe` from the ZIP.
- **far2l shared clipboard (GET)** — remote→clipboard (**SET**) is verified end-to-end; the
  **GET** direction (remote reads your clipboard) transmits over **SSH only**, not raw (a
  pre-existing PuTTY behaviour).
- **far2l clipboard "Ask" mode** (Window → Selection) — answering **OK** grants the remote
  clipboard access for the rest of the session (no per-request reprompt). Set it to **Disabled** to deny.
- **adb backend & rutty scripting** — verified against test fixtures, not yet against a real
  Android device / live remote shell.
- **SSH auto-login password** — encrypted at rest with Windows DPAPI (machine-bound; defeats offline/cross-user theft, not same-user malware, and does not move to another PC). A portable master-password option is planned; for the strongest security prefer SSH keys.
- **Background image** — the thin margin outside the terminal cell grid is still solid-filled (cosmetic).

## Building from source

Cross-compiled to Win64 with MinGW + CMake (Ninja) under WSL/Linux:

```bash
cmake -B build-mingw -G Ninja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchain-mingw.cmake
cmake --build build-mingw                 # whole tree
cmake --build build-mingw --target kitty  # just kitty.exe
```

The MSI installers are built from [`windows/installer/`](windows/installer/) with WiX v5.
For an orientation on how this fork is structured and ported — architecture, the `MOD_*` /
parallel-target approach, and the constraints to know before editing shared files — see
**[`PORTING.md`](PORTING.md)**.
